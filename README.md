### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I come from a scientific background, having graduated as a Chemical Engineer and worked with several computer simulations for various subjects and sources ranging from chemical reactors to fluid dynamics and nuclear physics. As of now I am currently looking to shift directions and work as a dev. I have either studied or worked with C, C++, C#, Python and HTML/CSS. 
Career-wise I consider my points of interest to be Gamification, Game development/design, Front-end/Back-end and software engineering.
Feel free to browse my portfolio and reach out to me if you have any inquiries!

Cheers :^)
